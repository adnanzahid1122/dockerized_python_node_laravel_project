# dockerized_python_node_laravel_project
Here in this project i have dockerized three projects (python, laravel and node ) in a single docker file and asingle docker-compose. The three project will run on the same webserver (Nginx) but on different ports. ie Port:80 will load the default page of nginx. Port:81 will load laravel project Port:82 will load node and Port 83 will load python.
